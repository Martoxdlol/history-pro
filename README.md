History Pro. A better replacement for native history api
=================

It uses interanlly this module: [nav-keys](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nav-keys)

**CAUTION: this package isnÂ´t complete and tested. It can catastrophically fail.**

```javascript
import HistoryPro from 'history-pro'

const historyPro = new HistoryPro(options /* see below */)

const cancel = historyPro.listen(e => {
    console.log(e)
    if(e.action == 'push') {
        // Add view to UI
        UI.addView(Views[e.nextLocation.pathname])
    }

    if(e.isBack) {
        UI.hideView()
    }

    if(e.isReplace) {
        UI.replaceView()
    }
})

homeBtn.onclick = () => historyPro.push('home')

cartBtn.onClick = () => historyPro.push('cart', {item:[...], price: 200, code: ...})

checkoutBtn.onClick = () => historyPro.push('checkout', {cart: {...}})
CheckoutProcess.onFinish = () => historyPro.replace('checkout/finished', {code: ...}) // Cant go back and see previous steps anymore

function openModal() {
    const cancel = historyPro.block((e, cancel) => {
        if(e.isBack) UI.closeModal()
        cancel()
    })
    // Open modal on UI
    UI.openModal({ onClose: () => cancel() })
}

```

```typescript

class HistoryPro {
    readonly options: Options; /* See below */

    constructor(options?: Options);
    /* Go n routes back and forward. Ej: go(-1) is equal to back() */
    go(n: number): void;
    /* Go to a specific index on history stack, or to the index of a NavLocation instance that already exists on the stack */
    goTo(position_or_navLocation: number | NavLocation): void;
    /* Go one position forward. Equal to: go(1) */
    forward();
    /* Go one position back. Equal to: go(-1) */
    back();
    /* Adds another location to the stack. If position is equal to currentIndex, it will be also a navigation event. by default, position is currentIndex */
    push(url, state?, position?);
    /* Replaces location at position on the stack. by default, position is currentIndex */
    replace(url, state?, position?);
    /* Removes a location from the stack at position (or current position) */
    pop(position?);
    /* Listen events */
    listen(listener: Function): Function/* unsubscribe function */;
    /* Adds a blocker, it will prevent from chaning location */
    block(blocker: Function, options?: BlockOptions): Function/* unsubscribe function */;
    /* Remove all blockers */
    clearBlockers();
    /* Hsitory stack length */
    get length(): number;
    /* Current location */
    get location(): NavLocation;
    /* current index on history stack (isn't really a stack) */
    get currentIndex(): number;
    /* current url */
    get url();
    /* current state */
    get state();
    /* get location of specific stack index */
    get(position: number): NavLocation;
    /* Index of NavLocation instance */
    indexOf(navLocation: NavLocation): number;
}
